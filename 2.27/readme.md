The task was to find sites about C++, C++17 or C++20. It's pretty weird but there weren't much resources out there. There are some links for (my) learning purposes.
1. https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17
2. https://infotraining.bitbucket.io/cpp-17/
3. https://dsp.krzaq.cc/post/1417/artykul-cpp17-nowy-milosciwie-panujacy-nam-standard-c-z-programisty-66/
4. https://cpp-polska.pl/tag/c++17
